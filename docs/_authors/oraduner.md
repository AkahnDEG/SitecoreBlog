Hi ðŸ‘‹
my name is Oliver and I worked over 7 years in the Sitecore team at former Namics.

I was part in consulting and delivering more than 12 large-scaled Sitecore experience platform-projects, before building-up a dedicated continuous delivery team for the valued existing Sitecore customers. I helped pushing the engagement in the Sitecore community and I am very happy today to see it's still thriving.

In 2019 it was time for me to move on. This page here I ~~sneaked in~~ added to the blog with the help of my former colleagues, as a small memorial to our shared Â«*good'ol Sitecore times*Â» ðŸ˜Ž.
