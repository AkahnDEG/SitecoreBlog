This year [Sitecore Virtual Developer Day 2021](https://www.sitecore.com/webinars/2021/03/virtual-developer-day) took place online as usual. Unlike other Sitecore events that had to switch to online virtual format since 2020, Sitecore Virtual Developer Day has always been in online format, nevertheless, this time it was different too!

First, the presentations content was very strong this year like never before! The speakers did a fantastic job and covered all latest and greatest Sitecore related technology topics, like Content Hub, Experience Edge, Sitecore Forms, SXA, JSS and Jamstack, deployment to Containers, customizing Sitecore Marketing Automation, integration with Salesforce, Sitecore Experience Commerce, and more!

Second, this time the event was broadcasted directly from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2BXGTWkLuw)! This allowed watching the event within a greater video quality, provided super-easy navigation between the sessions and allowed the attendees choosing their own pace to watch the event, even selecting the speed of the presentation playback!
